Legacy Examples
===========

These are no longer updated.

`PerferenceDemo` uses the preference activity/fragment to save data.  This works to figure out 3.X+ and above, and below to use the different preference methods.  annoying actually.

`fileSystemDemo` shows how to read/write to local private and public directory and the "external" media like an sdcard.  The external stops working at api 29, which is why a copy of the old code is here.

`sqliteDemo` creates a supportSQLitedatabase and content provider

`sqliteDemo2` uses the content provider from sqlitedemo, also shows how to use a loader.

`sqliteDemo3` uses the content provider from sqlitedemo and recyclerview.  Uses a custom cursoradapter for it and a loader as well.

`sqliteDemo4` uses the content provider from sqlitedemo and recyclerview.  Uses a custom LiveData, plus a modelview to replace the deprecated Loaders.

These are example code for University of Wyoming, Cosc 4730 Mobile Programming course.
All examples are for Android.
