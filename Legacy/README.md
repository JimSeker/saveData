Legacy Examples
===========

These are no longer updated.

<b>PerferenceDemo</b> uses the preference activity/fragment to save data.  This works to figure out 3.X+ and above, and below to use the different preference methods.  annoying actually.

<b>fileSystemDemo</b> shows how to read/write to local private and public directory and the "external" media like an sdcard.  The external stops working at api 29, which is why a copy of the old code is here.

These are example code for University of Wyoming, Cosc 4730 Mobile Programming course.
All examples are for Android.
